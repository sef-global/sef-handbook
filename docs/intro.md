# SEF Handbook

The SEF team handbook is the central repository for how we run the organisation. As part of our value of being
transparent the handbook is open to the world, and we welcome feedback. Please make a pull request to suggest
improvements or add clarifications. Please use issues to ask questions.

## History of the handbook

The handbook started when SEF was a organisation of just twenty people to make sharing information efficient and easy.
We knew that future SEF team-members wouldn't be able to see emails about process changes that were being sent before
they joined and that most of the people who would eventually join SEF likely hadn't even heard of us yet. The handbook
was our way of ensuring that all of our organisation information was accessible to everyone regardless of when they
became part of the team.

## Advantages

At SEF our handbook is extensive and keeping it relevant is an important part of everyone's job. It is a vital part of
who we are and how we communicate. We established these processes because we saw these benefits:

1. Reading is much faster than listening.
1. Reading is async, you don't have to interrupt someone or wait for them to become available.
1. Talent Acquisition is easier if people can see what we stand for and how we operate.
1. Retention is better if people know what they are getting into before they join.
1. On-boarding is easier if you can find all relevant information spelled out.
1. Teamwork is easier if you can read how other parts of the company work.
1. Discussing changes is easier if you can read what the current process is.
1. Communicating change is easier if you can just point to the diff.
1. Everyone can contribute to it by proposing a change via a pull request.

One common concern newcomers to the handbook express is that the strict documentation makes the origanisation more
rigid. In fact, writing down our current process in the handbook has the effect of empowering contributors to propose
change. As a result, this handbook is far from rigid. You only need to look at the handbook changelog to see the
evidence. Every attempt is made to document guidelines and processes in the handbook. However, it is not possible to
document every possible situation or scenario that could potentially occur. Just because something is not yet in the
handbook does not mean that it is allowed. SEF will review each team member's concern or situation based on local laws
to determine the best outcome and then update the handbook accordingly. If you have questions, please discuss with your
team lead or contact the Administrative team.

## Handbook Interpretation

The handbook is subject to interpretation. We do our best to be as clear as possible to minimize confusion and/or
misinterpretation. We also recognize that we have a global audience and that may bring different interpretations. If you
have any questions or need further clarification please check with the content owner of the page. When in doubt please
reach out and ask.

Remember that everything is in draft at SEF and subject to change, this includes our handbook.
