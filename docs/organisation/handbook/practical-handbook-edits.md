# Practical Handbook Edits Examples

This page contains video recordings and written instructions on how to work Handbook-First for non-engineering team
members. In these videos, we walk through the SEF Handbook with experts, learning how to best use the Handbook in our
day-to-day work and picking up best practices for Handbook editing along the way. This page contains some examples from
GitLab, the company from which we drew inspiration for the SEF handbook. However, we use github to maintain our
handbook. Therefore, this page should be updated with current information.

Please note that the video mentions that you need to go to `source/handbook` to create a page which is no longer the
case. The handbook is located under `_docs`.

    - What they look like
    - Use cases for using them in the handbook Note: Flowcharts are universally used to outline the steps of a processes
      in sequential
      order. [Every shape or symbol has its own function in a flowchart.](https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/flowchart-symbols-meaning-explained)

## More Tips

### Pre-requisites

Some tips may require terminal shell access on macOS/Linux. Ensure that your environment is working and that you have
cloned the www-gitlab-com project for example.

```
git clone https://github.com/sef-global/handbook.git
```

Sync it. Ensure that you stash away local changed not yet committed.

```
cd handbook
git stash
git checkout master
git pull
```

On macOS it is advised to use Homebrew and install the GNU tools.
See [this blogpost](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2020/04/17/dotfiles-document-and-automate-your-macbook-setup/) for a
macOS setup.

```
brew install gnu-sed
```

### Find files

One of the shell tools provided with macOS/Linux GNU is `find`. Open a terminal an run the following command in the main
directory of the `handbook` repository to get a list of all *.md files. This matches .md as suffix.

```
find . -type f -name '*.md'
```

Instead of the `.` you can also use a directory in the current path.

```
find source/handbook -type f -name '*.md'
```

The type `f` specifies files, `d` matches for directories. When not specified, all files and directories are taken into
account. You can replace `-name` with `-regex` to do more sensitive matching, for example to match all `.md`
and `.md.erb` files.

```
find . -type f -regex '.*\.md[.erb]*'
```
