# Google Summer of Code Contributor Guidelines

Are you interested in participating in a Google Summer of Code project with SEF? We're excited to guide you toward becoming a successful GSoC contributor in our community. To assist you, we've compiled some guidelines and sessions that address your initial questions and provide insight into what is expected of students before proposal submission, after acceptance, and during the coding period.
## General Guidelines

#### Before the Application
1. Get acquainted with SEF and your chosen projects by referring to the [Getting Started](https://handbook.sefglobal.org/engineering-team/team) as a Developer.
2. Initiate your involvement by asking questions and exploring project ideas on SEF Hive.
3. Active participation in the SEF Slack channel and SEF Hive is crucial for community engagement.
4. Introduce yourself in the [introduction](https://sef.discourse.group/t/welcome-please-introduce-yourself/7?u=anjisvj) thread on SEF Hive to connect with the community.
5. Contribute to SEF on GitHub by selecting issues, working on them, and submitting pull requests to the relevant repository.
6. Identify potential issues within SEF projects and create new GitHub issues for those that haven't been reported.
7. Boost your presence on SEF Hive and Slack by assisting others and actively participating in discussions.
8. Sharpen your understanding of the SEF code base by conducting code reviews, an essential part of the learning process.

**Additional Expectations:**
- Contribute valuable information by writing blogs about SEF or related topics.
- Document your work thoroughly on Hive and support others in building upon it.

#### After Being Accepted
1. Establish a blog for your open source projects, including GSoC, and share the URL on SEF Hive. Provide weekly updates on planning and project progress during GSoC.
2. Initiate contact with your mentor promptly and set up a regular communication plan using Slack or SEF Hive discussions.
3. Keep your backup mentor informed of your progress by including them in communications.
4. Work on initial bugs or feature development related to your project with guidance from your mentor by reviewing GitHub issues.
5. Develop a detailed project plan with SMART goals and milestones, and share it on SEF Hive.

#### During the Coding Period
1. Submit concise weekly progress updates.
2. Write weekly blog posts to publicly share your work.
3. Follow the open-source community values by committing early and often.
4. Prepare mid-term and final project presentation videos for the community.

**Developer Community Expectations:**
- Conduct all project-related discussions on Slack or SEF Hive.
- Pose questions intelligently when facing challenges.
- Participate in weekly standup calls whenever your schedule permits.

#### After GSoC
1. Summarize your overall experience in a final blog post.
2. Stay involved with your project or other projects based on your schedule.
3. Monitor SEF Hive for additional questions or feedback about your GSoC project and other interesting topics.
4. Consider participating as a mentor for GSoC, if SEF is accepted, to inspire secondary school students to use their programming skills in open source projects.
