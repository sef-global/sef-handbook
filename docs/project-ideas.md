# Google Summer of Code 2024 

Sustainable Education Foundation is excited to announce our first-time application to be a mentoring organization for [Google Summer of Code](http://g.co/gsoc) 2025! We are eager to be part of this esteemed program and are looking forward to the potential projects and mentorship opportunities available in 2025. Participating in Google Summer of Code with SEF provides a unique chance to enhance your coding skills while contributing to initiatives that have a positive impact on education in developing countries.

If you are new to Sustainable Education Foundation, we recommend going through our [handbook](https://handbook.sefglobal.org/engineering-team/team).

## Project Ideas

1. *ScholarX Messaging*
    - Description: The project involves creating a messaging feature for a web application to enhance communication between mentors and mentees in ScholarX. The key features expected include a user-friendly chat interface with real-time messaging, support for text messages, and possibly file attachments.
    - Skills: React, TypeScript, Node.js
    - Mentors: [Kumuditha Karunarathne](https://sef.discourse.group/u/kumuditha_udayanga/summary) (Primary), [Mayura Alahakoon](https://sef.discourse.group/u/mayura_andrew) (Secondary)
    - Rating and Size: Medium, 175 hours
    - Outcomes: [Project Link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1F3PSc26HGoXSlEp8wtX3I86JesNIY6Aqbtr9O12Hu5U/edit?usp=sharing)

2. *Integrated Email Communication System for ScholarX Platform*
    - Description: To enhance communication within the ScholarX platform, an integrated email system will be implemented. This will allow program admins to seamlessly contact mentors and mentees directly through the platform, eliminating the need for external email systems. The integration will include features such as composing, sending, and receiving emails, as well as organizing and tracking communications for monitoring purposes.
    - Skills: React, TypeScript, Node.js, Email API Integration (e.g., SMTP for sending emails, IMAP for receiving emails)
    - Mentors: [Mayura Alahakoon](https://sef.discourse.group/u/mayura_andrew) (Primary), Heshan Jayaneththi (Secondary)
    - Rating and Size: Medium, 175 hours
    - Outcomes: [Project Link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11huIaWMS4rnr0sBAZmfs4bsqRhZNRnUM9g8xyMchmwU/edit?usp=sharing)

3. *Individual Profile for Mentors/Mentees*
    - Description: It would be beneficial to provide ScholarX users (mentors and mentees) with a means to share their ScholarX profiles as a portfolio. This feature would enable them to showcase their activities, including past mentorships (both taken and given), reviews, and other pertinent details such as their background, skills, and experience.
    - Skills: React, TypeScript, Node.js
    - Mentors: [Piumal Rathnayake](https://sef.discourse.group/u/piumal1999/summary) (Primary), [Kumuditha Karunarathne](https://sef.discourse.group/u/kumuditha_udayanga/summary) (Secondary)
    - Rating and Size: Medium, 175 hours
    - Outcomes: [Project Link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FEqCtsCq0lXordYv9kQCUEW4h_Wvphwy5OcaGUFfPyc/edit?usp=sharing)

4. *Integrated Appointment System for ScholarX Platform*
    - Description: One of the key requirements of the ScholarX program is to understand the interactions between the mentees and the mentors. However, since most of the meeting/discussion scheduling happens outside the platform, program admins have to rely on manual feedback collections to monitor aspects like frequency of discussions, discussed topics, etc.
    - Skills: React, TypeScript, Node.js
    - Mentors: [Ashen Hirantha](https://sef.discourse.group/u/ashen_hirantha/summary) (Primary), [Anjula Samarasinghe](https://sef.discourse.group/u/anjisvj/activity) (Secondary)
    - Rating and Size: Medium, 175 hours
    - Outcomes: [Project Link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CRxfSprtGpjtS1JtYSKXs0eeBtZrkYN5D6iYSJe6t5Q/edit?usp=sharing)

5. *Recommendation System for ScholarX Platform*
    - Description: Currently, in the ScholarX Platform, mentees can filter mentors by category and find a suited mentor, but we want to implement a more sophisticated recommendation system, which will analyze mentees' responses to questions to identify their interests and then match mentees with mentors based on similar interests, providing a more personalized and effective mentorship experience.
    - Skills: Understanding of machine learning algorithms for analysis, Familiarity with creating web services and APIs, Python
    - Mentors: [Madhawa Monarawila](https://sef.discourse.group/u/madhawa/summary) (Primary), [Akshika Wijesundara](https://sef.discourse.group/u/akshika47/summary) (Secondary)
    - Rating and Size: Medium, 175 hours
    - Outcomes: [Project Link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ndXqo7LghoYoirI4aGvc7rQNo88NLePaV2BWN_QC1qA/edit?usp=sharing)

6. *Program Progress Data Visualization for ScholarX*
    - Description: We need to get some insights on whatâ€™s happening with the program. The best solution to this is to visualize the data we have in a meaningful way. We can integrate this to our existing admin dashboard. With this information we can make better decisions to make the ScholarX program better.
    - Skills: React, TypeScript, Node.js
    - Mentors: [Anjula Samarasinghe](https://sef.discourse.group/u/anjisvj/activity) (Primary), [Madhawa Monarawila](https://sef.discourse.group/u/madhawa/summary) (Secondary)
    - Rating and Size: Medium, 175 hours
