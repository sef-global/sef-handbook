# Goals

Our aim is to enable the Sri Lankan education system to develop into one where: 

- **Knowledge** is acquired via both traditional and non traditional pathways without infrastructure limitations. 
- Students graduate with in-demand employability/entrepreneurial **skills**. 
- **Values** like genuine curiosity, capability for research, social justice and ownership/responsibility are instilled in students.
- **Attitudes** such as resilience, self-reliance and growth mindset are instilled from an early age in students. 


In turn moving Sri Lanka from brain drain to brain gain by:

- Breaking cultural stereotyping of careers and higher education options.
- Connecting Sri Lankan expats with local students to broaden their career and education options.
- Providing in demand skills to graduates that improve their employability.
